## intro
I'm a naval architect and mechanical engineer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. My experience is in the design, analysis, simulation and fabrication of underwater vehicles, surface vessels and hydro-mechanical systems. Areas of interest include UUVs, mechanical systems, hydrodynamics, electric propulsion, underwater vehicle dynamics, computational fluid dynamics and product design.

I enjoy the creative process of design and fabrication. To me, naval architecture offers the ability to blend scientific principles and aesthetic elements into elegant designs.
