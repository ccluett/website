I'm a [senior naval architect and mechanical engineer](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/ccluett/) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution specializing in underwater vehicle design, applied maritime research and technology development. My work focuses on the research and development of autonomous underwater vehicles, surface vehicles, and advanced technologies in hydrodynamics, propulsion, subsea structures and complex systems.

I apply theoretical and computational capabilities in fluid dynamics, dynamic modeling, and structural analysis to conduct applied engineering and hardware development. My work is rooted in real-world application and continual feedback from at-sea system deployment & performance.
