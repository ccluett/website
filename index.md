I'm a naval architect and mechanical engineer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, focused on applied maritime research and technology development. I aim to design, develop, and demonstrate innovative technologies related to hydrodynamics, propulsion, structures, and hydro-mechanical systems for autonomous underwater vehicles and surface vessels.

I conduct applied engineering, research, and hardware development using strong theoretical and computational capabilities in fluid dynamics, dynamic modeling, and structural analysis, informed by at-sea operations and real-world feedback.
