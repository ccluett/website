## intro
I'm a naval architect and mechanical engineer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, with experience in the design, analysis, simulation and fabrication of underwater vehicles, surface vessels and hydro-mechanical systems. I enjoy the creative process of design and fabrication. To me, Naval Architecture offers the ability to blend architectural and artistic elements into design, while remaining rooted in physics.

Areas of interest include large UUVs, mechanical systems, hydrodynamics, electric propulsion, underwater vehicle dynamics, computational fluid dynamics and website design.
