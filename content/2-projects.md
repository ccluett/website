## US National Park Service *Annie Moore* 

The *Annie Moore* is a 74 ft steel-hulled Subchapter T passenger and utility vessel for the National Park Service, servicing the Statue of Liberty Monument and Ellis Island in New York Harbor. The design included an ice-classed hull and propulsion system. CFD was used in design to help optimize vessel hull shape and ensure suitable hydrodynamics. The basis of design was the US Army Corps of Engineers 60 ft debris collection vessel *Reynolds*. I completed the design drawing package, structural analysis, weights and centers, Subchapter T stability, tonnage calculations, and CFD for this vessel.
