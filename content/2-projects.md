## US National Park Service *Annie Moore* 

The *Annie Moore* is a 74 ft steel-hulled Subchapter T passenger and utility vessel for the National Park Service, servicing the Statue of Liberty Monument and Ellis Island in New York Harbor. The design included an ice-classed hull and propulsion system. CFD was used in design to help optimize vessel hull shape and ensure suitable hydrodynamics. The basis of design was the US Army Corps of Engineers 60 ft debris collection vessel *Reynolds*. I completed the design drawing package, structural analysis, weights and centers, Subchapter T stability, tonnage calculations, and CFD for this vessel.

## Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) Bunkering Barge *Clean Jacksonville* 

The *Clean Jacksonville* was the first LNG bunkering barge built in North America. Along with my collegues at Bristol Harbor, we were responsibile for the design and engineering of the barge, including technical and shipyard support during construction. Additionally, I was highly involved in the regulatory process with the USCG, ABS and other entities to obtain design approval for a vessel outside of existing USCG and ABS regulatory policy. The barge was designed to bunker the first class of LNG-fueled containerships operated by Tote Maritime, running Jones Act routes between Jacksonville, FL and Puerto Rico. The barge is a single tank, equipped with French-based GTT's membrane style containment technology. Gasentec, a Korean-based company, was responbile for the cryogenic handling system design and analysis. The barge was built at Conrad Orange Shipyard, in Orange, TX. It includes onboard re-liquefaction to re-convert gaseous NG to LNG, maintaining a low internal tank pressure. A transfer boom allows cryogenic LNG transfer from barge to ship.
