Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) CFD is a time averaged approch to simulate a flow field. I use Ansys Fluent to solve applied hydrodynamics problems using RANS CFD, such as performance and powering prediction of UUVs and surface vessels, control surface modeling, and interaction of components in a flow field.

## DARPA SUBOFF

The DARPA SUBOFF model and Carderock Tow Tank data are available in the public domain and serve as a valdiation data set for CFD. Using 3D RANS CFD, good correlation is able to be demonstrated between tow tank and CFD.

## Solcum Glider Flight Performance

CFD aided in identifying and quantifying poor flight performance of a Solcum Glider, and helped develop solutions for integration of scientific sensors.

## Propeller Performance Simulation

Propeller performance can be modeled using different approaches using both steady and unsteady RANS. For highest fielding overset grids are simulated in a transient approach. Rotating frames of reference can be used for a steady state approximation, which allow for a computationally efficient simulation.
