I design, analyze, build, and test machined, welded, composite, cast, and 3D printed parts. All these means of manufacturing have their place depending on application. 

I help continue the development of the REMUS line of underwater vehicles, as well as design and develop various other oceanographic and subsea systems and hardware.

My driving principles are simplicity and elegance in design, and the importance of designing with top system level understanding and overall design intent.

## structural design

I use both finite element and first-principles based analysis to structurally design subsea components and hardware, including large deformation nonlinear collapse  of pressure vessels and boundaries.
