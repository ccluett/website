I design, analyze, build, and test vehicles, vessels and complex hydro-mechanical systems. I design machined, welded, composite, cast, and 3D printed components. All these means of manufacturing have their place depending on application. 

I use both first-principles and finite element analyses to design hardware, including large deformation non-linear, modal and thermal FEA.

My driving principles are simplicity and elegance in design. I believe in the importance of designing with top system level understanding and overall design intent.
