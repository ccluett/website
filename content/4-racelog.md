## michigan cycling
Collegiate cycling is everything sports should be: a DIY ethos; largely unstructured, but structured just enough to function; future olympians and people racing for the first time; competitive but relaxed, and everyone hangs out together regardless afterwards. I was team president in 2011, hosted two race weekends and oversaw our yearly spring break training trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains in Georgia. Eventually I'd like to find and log over 4 years of lost road, mountain and cyclocross racing between 2008 to 2012. For now, a few photos from the archives...
